Our intuition is that factors such as playtime, number of players, minimum age, and the overall complexity may influence how a game is rated. While our approach is a simple linear regression, it is often surprising how much insight can be gained from an elementary model. There may be more sophisticated techniques in the future, but humility (and dry wit) reminds us that sometimes the simplest approach is the best starting point."

    "This notebook provided an exploratory analysis of a complex board games dataset. We cleaned the data, visualized relationships between various features using heatmaps, pair plots, histograms, and box plots, and built a simple predictor for average ratings. The use of a linear regression model was a first step; future work could involve more advanced algorithms, feature engineering, and text analytics from game descriptions.\n",
